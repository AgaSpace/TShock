TShock is a server mod for [[Terraria]]. Started in 2011, it began as the first free and open source mod for [[Terraria]] designed for server owners. It predates the official Terraria dedicated server. For a brief period of time, TShock was offered as a direct download on the official website.

TShock is [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) software. That means that it comes without any warranty, but you can distribute it and its source code for free or for money under the [terms and conditions of the license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

Unlike [[tModLoader]], TShock focuses on creating a server-side experience for server admins, not dependent on installing a client mod. "Mods" designed for [[tModLoader]] do not function with TShock, and the two are functionally separate ideas. By running a TShock server, you can have a similar-to-Minecraft experience, in the sense that you don't need users to download and install additional client software or client mods to experience your server.

Modern [[TShock]] is hosted on [[OTAPI]], a project from [[DeathCradle]], one of the founders of [[TDSM]].
