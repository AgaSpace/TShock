The default owner group in TShock is intended to have all "reasonable" perimissions to play the game with ultimate authority and control the server with ultimate authority, like [[superadmin]], but without dangerous permissions that might make the gameplay experience atypical.

Unlike the superadmin group, the owner group doesn't automatically get all permissions.
