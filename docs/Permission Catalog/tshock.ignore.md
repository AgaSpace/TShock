This [[group]] of [[permissions]] is typically used to ignore anti-cheat checks that [[TShock]] performs. Usually, you give these [[permissions]] to people who you expect to be using modded clients, hacks, or cheats. Sometimes, though, it's necessary to give these [[permissions]] to [[player|players]] if the game has recently been updated, and the anti-cheat is giving false positives.
