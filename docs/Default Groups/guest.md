The guest group is the lowest default group provided by TShock. By default, when users aren't logged in, they live in the guest group.

The guest group is the best group to customize for users that aren't logged in. By default, they can modify the world, chat, login, register for an account, talk in third person, and that's about it.

On many servers, the guest group cannot modify the world. This is the best group to secure or lock down out of the box, because it has very little access to other server features.

By default, once a guest registers and logs in, they switch to the [[default]] group.
