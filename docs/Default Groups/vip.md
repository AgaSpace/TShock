The VIP group is intended to give slightly more permissions to users than the [[default]] and [[guest]] groups.

VIPs can teleport using pylons, rename NPCs, use [[reserved slots]], and start invasions by default.

In general, this is a group that is intended to be customized. If you have a group of players that you trust and like on your server, this is the easiest group to give more permissions to. It provides a level of separation between the default and guest groups, in the sense that people have to be manually added to it, which is a basic form of vetting.
