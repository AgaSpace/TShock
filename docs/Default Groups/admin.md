The admin group is more similar to a "mod" group than anything else in the default group set.

It is immune to being kicked from [[newadmin]]. Unlike [[trustedadmin]], it doesn't bypass anticheat features through permissions by default. It also doesn't include world event permissions and other similar permissions.
