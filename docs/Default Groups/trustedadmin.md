`trustedadmin` is intended to be a default group from [[TShock]] that gives a lot more permissions over the default [[admin]] group. This is typically distinguished by being able to defeat many of the internal anti-cheat mechanisms through permissions. The intent is that server owners give their most trusted admins this group, as opposed to [[owner]] as owner is more powerful for servermaintenance purposes.
