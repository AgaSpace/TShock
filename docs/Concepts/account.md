An account is a stored representation of a player's metadata that is stored in the [[database]] that TShock uses to identify things persistently.

Because [[Terraria]] doesn't have any way to identify players natively, TShock has an account system. When players connect, they somehow login to an account. Once logged in, the account they log into contains data about them that is stored between sessions.

Each [[player]] can be logged into only one account at a time.
