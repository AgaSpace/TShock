The word "server" has several meanings. In general, when people refer to a "TShock server", they mean the program `TerrariaServer.exe` running all the time, running the TShock mod and associated plugins.

The server establishes the game world for players to play on, and as long as the program is running and connected to the Internet, new [[player|players]] can connect and play on that server.
