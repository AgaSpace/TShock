A group is a collection that [[account|accounts]] belong to. It is a way of defining certain settings for the [[player|players]] logged into [[account|accounts]] that belong to it.

The default groups that [[TShock]] creates are:
* [[admin]]
* [[default]]
* [[guest]]
* [[newadmin]]
* [[owner]]
* [[superadmin]]
* [[trustedadmin]]
* [[vip]]

Each group can have a parent group and child groups. Child groups inherit their parents' [[Permissions|permissions]].

For the purposes of customization, each group can also have a designated [[chat prefix]], [[chat suffix]], and [[chat color]], in addition to [[Permissions|permissions]].
